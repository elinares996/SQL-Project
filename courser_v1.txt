Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000 (id)
ii. Hours = 1562 (business_id)
iii. Category = 2643 (business_id)
iv. Attribute = 1115 (business_id)
v. Review = 1000 (id) 
vi. Checkin = 493 (business_id)
vii. Photo = 10000(id)
viii. Tip = 3979 (business_id) 537(user_id)
ix. User = 10000(id)
x. Friend = 11 (user_id)
xi. Elite_years = 2780(user_id)

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
select c.business_id, city, category, hours, stars
from business b
inner join category c on b.id = c.business_id
inner join hours h on h.business_id = b.id
where stars = 4 or stars = 5 and hours like 'monday%'
order by stars desc 
I used this to find the amount of records in the data table and it seems those with less stars have less hours and not open as much as those with more stars

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
select c.business_id, city, category, hours, stars, sum(review_count)
from business b
inner join category c on b.id = c.business_id
inner join hours h on h.business_id = b.id
where stars = 2 or stars = 3  
order by stars desc 
what i used to find the number of reviews

yes the one with more stars has significantly more reviews with 110325 and the ones ranging from 2-3 stars have 18769     
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

SQL code used for analysis:
select c.business_id, city, count(city) as number, category, hours, stars
from business b
inner join category c on b.id = c.business_id
inner join hours h on h.business_id = b.id
Group by city
order by number desc
It seems the most hours that occur are on saturdays late into the night

		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1: difference 1 there are 337 cities where businesses open is greater than business not open and only 13 cities where the opposite is true 
         
         
ii. Difference 2: difference 2 is that although those cities top 5 cities with the most business open they have a similar range of average stars from 3.4-3.9 whereas for the top 5 cities with business not open  the t average stars seems to have a bigger range from 3.3-5
         
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:
select city,
count(case when is_open = 0 then 1 end ) as 'notopen',
count(case when is_open = 1 then 1 end) as 'open', AVG(stars) as 'avg'
from business 
Group by city
having notopen > open
order by  notopen desc
limit 5
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
 I chose to see if there is any correlation between category, star , and reviews in the city of Toronto        
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
The data I will need to do this analysis is the category of each business from category table, the star rating and the review_count from business table in the city of toronto.
                           
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
+---------+----------------+-----------------+---------------+--------------+
| city    | category       | Number_Category |       average | review_count |
+---------+----------------+-----------------+---------------+--------------+
| Toronto | Restaurants    |              71 | 3.45774647887 |           89 |
| Toronto | Food           |              23 | 3.78260869565 |            3 |
| Toronto | Specialty Food |               5 |           4.0 |            3 |
| Toronto | Pubs           |               5 |           3.4 |           15 |
| Toronto | Sushi Bars     |               4 |           3.5 |            3 |
+---------+----------------+-----------------+---------------+--------------+         
         
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:
select city, category, count(category) as 'Number_Category', AVG(stars) as 'average', Review_count
from business b 
inner join category c on c.business_id = b.id
group by category
having city like 'Toronto'
order by Number_Category desc, average desc
limit 5
